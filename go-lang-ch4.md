# Composite Types
1. Arrays and structs are aggregate types; their values are concatenations of other values in memory. Arrays are homogeneous and structs are heterogeneous.
2. Both arrays and structs are fixed size. In contrast, slices and maps are dynamic data structures that grow as values are added.
